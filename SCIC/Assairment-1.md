**Interpersonal Backpack**

1. **Tell me about yourself.**

My name is Siham Binta Habib, and I am currently a BBA student in my 5th semester at Notre Dame University Bangladesh. Alongside my business studies, I have developed a strong passion for frontend web development. I have taught myself modern technologies like HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, and Next.js. Outside of coding, I enjoy solving problems, learning new technologies, and continuously improving my craft.

2. **Why should we hire you? / Why are you suitable for the post?**

You should hire me because I possess the technical skills required for the Frontend Web Developer role, including proficiency in modern frontend technologies. Combined with my business background, I bring a unique perspective on user needs and project management. I am dedicated, quick to learn, and committed to delivering high-quality work that meets both technical and business goals.

3. **How do you stay motivated and engaged in your work over the long term?**

My family is my biggest source of motivation—they always encourage me, believe in my abilities, and support me through every challenge, which keeps me going even on difficult days. In addition, my faith plays a vital role in maintaining my focus and energy. I regularly pray Namaz, which brings me peace, clarity, and renewed strength. Reading Islamic books and reflections also inspires me to stay patient, disciplined, and grateful, helping me remain consistently engaged and motivated in my studies and web development work over the long term.

4. **Tell me about your three weak points.**

- Sometimes I try to handle too many tasks at once (multitasking overload), which can lead to feeling stuck or delayed progress. I am working on better prioritization to overcome this.
- I am still improving my fluency in English, especially in professional communication.
- Occasionally, I get overly focused on details, which can slow me down, but I am learning to balance perfection with efficiency.

5. **Tell me about your three weak points.**

- Sometimes I try to handle too many tasks at once (multitasking overload), which can lead to feeling stuck or delayed progress. I am working on better prioritization to overcome this.
- I am still improving my fluency in English, especially in professional communication.
- Occasionally, I get overly focused on details, which can slow me down, but I am learning to balance perfection with efficiency.

6. **What was your biggest mistake in your life?**

My biggest mistake was not focusing on learning English fluently from childhood. This has sometimes created communication challenges. However, I am actively improving through daily practice, online courses, and real-world application like talk english, and I have seen significant progress.

7. **What types of projects or technologies are you most excited to work on in the future?**

I am very excited about projects that integrate AI into web applications and streamline the website development process. I look forward to exploring how AI tools can enhance user experiences, automate tasks, and revolutionize frontend development.

8. **How do you handle situations where you encounter a problem for which you don't immediately have a solution?**

As a BBA student, my academic lessons help me greatly. I apply management fundamentals and follow a structured problem-solving and decision-making process:

Step 1: Identify the problem clearly.

Step 2: Analyze the issue, compare it with the expected outcome, and find the root cause.

Step 3: Generate possible solutions.

Step 4: Evaluate the options and choose the best one.

Step 5: Implement the solution and monitor the results. This structured approach helps me resolve issues effectively and learn from them.

9. **Where do you see yourself in the next 5 years?**

In the next five years, I see myself working as a frontend developer while also building a career in Chartered Accountant (CA), combining my technical and business skills for a successful career in the corporate world.

10. **Can you describe a situation where you failed?What did you learn from it?**

I failed academically in class 6, which was a turning point in my life. From that experience, I learned the importance of studying seriously and staying disciplined. With strong family support, I understood that failure is a pillar of success and used it as motivation to improve.
